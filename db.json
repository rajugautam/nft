Whether you want to develop a regular attitude of gratitude or youâ€™re brainstorming your way to the next big thing, these notebooks are designed to help you reach your dreams.\n\nPleurocybella porrigens belongs to the family Tricholomataceae and is found on coniferous trees such as cedar. This mushroom has traditionally been considered edible throughout the world; however, in 2004, ingestion of this mushroom was linked to several incidences of unexplained acute encephalopathy. Our research group obtained a large amount of this mushroom immediately after this incident and evaluated whether the toxicity may have originated within the mushroom itself. As a result, we found that intraperitoneal injection of P. porrigens extracts resulted in mortality in a mouse experiment. Therefore, we attempted to isolate the toxic compound(s), and successfully purified a glycoprotein. The glycoprotein was shown to be closely associated with the mushroom's toxic phenotype and we named the protein pleurocybellin (PC) (manuscript in preparation). It was suggested that the incidents of acute encephalopathy might involve lectin(s), in light of the high hemagglutinating activity of the mushroom. Therefore, we attempted to obtain the lectin(s) and finally succeeded in the purification, primary structure determination, gene cloning, and construction of a heterologous expression system of a lectin (P. porrigens lectin, PPL) (Suzuki et al. 2009, 2014). However, no toxicity was observed following administration of PC and PPL to mice brain.",
